# GuanCEST, amineCEST, and amideCEST mappings of stroke mouse models
##  9.4T
Please download all the codes, add the toolbox folder to the path, and then run the Main400Hz_allB1.m, which will provide GuanCEST, amineCEST, and amideCEST mappings of the sampled data of a permanent Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse brain scanned at a B₁ of 0.8 μT.
When you run the codes, GuanCEST image will pop up and saved in your defined folder:
